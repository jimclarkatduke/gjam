# gjam
data sets and examples for import by gjam vignettes in R.

`gjam` models multivariate responses that can be combinations of discrete and continuous variables, where interpretation is needed on the observation scale. It was motivated by the challenges of modeling distribution and abundance of multiple species, so-called joint species distribution models (JSDMs).  Because species and other attributes are often recorded on many different scales and with different levels of sampling effort, many analyses are limited to presence-absence, the lowest common denominator.  Combining species and other attributes is challenging because some species groups are counted.  Some may be continuous cover values or basal area.  Some may be recorded in ordinal bins, such as 'rare', 'moderate', and 'abundant'.  Others may be presence-absence.  Some are composition data, either fractional (continuous on (0, 1)) or counts (e.g., molecular and fossil pollen data).  Attributes such as body condition, infection status, and herbivore damage are often included in field data.  `gjam` accommodate multifarious observations.
